## Overview

This challenge was to create a tip calculator to calculate how much a person/persons will pay when the user provides the bill total, the amount of tip they wish to leave, and how many people the bill is going to be spread to.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
